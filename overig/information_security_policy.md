## 10. Network security 

  - Firewalls must be implemented at each internet connection and any demilitarized zone and the internal company network. 
  - A network diagram detailing all the inbound and outbound connections must be maintained and reviewed every 6 months. 
  - A firewall and router configuration must be maintained. 
  - Firewall and router configurations must restrict connections between untrusted networks and any systems in the data environment. 
  - Stateful Firewall technology must be implemented where the Internet enters the company network to mitigate known and on-going threats.

## 11. Password Policy 

All users, including contractors and vendors with access to {{CompanyName}} systems, are responsible for taking the appropriate steps, as outlined below, to select and secure their passwords. 

  - All vendor default accounts and passwords for the systems have to be changed at the time of provisioning the system/device into the company network and all unnecessary services and user/system accounts have to be disabled. 
  - All unnecessary default accounts must be removed or disabled before installing a system on the network. 
  - All unnecessary functionality (scripts, drivers, features, subsystems, file systems, web servers etc.,) must be removed. 
  - All unnecessary services, protocols, daemons etc., should be disabled if not in use by the system.

    - Include digits and punctuation marks, if possible. 
    - Not be based on any personal information. 
    - Not be based on any dictionary word, in any language. 
  - If an operating system without security features is used (such as DOS, Windows or MacOS), then an intruder only needs temporary physical access to the console to insert a keyboard monitor program. If the workstation is not physically secured, then an intruder can reboot even a secure operating system, restart the workstation from his own media, and insert the offending program. 
  - To protect against network analysis attacks, both the workstation and server should be cryptographically secured. 

## 12. Anti-virus policy 

  - All machines must be configured to run the latest anti-virus software as approved by {{CompanyName}}. The preferred application to use is Bitdefender Anti-Virus software, which must be configured to retrieve the latest updates to the antiviral program automatically on a daily basis.

  - All Workstations, servers, software, system components etc. owned by {{CompanyName}} must have up-to-date system security patches installed to protect the asset from known vulnerabilities. 
  - Where ever possible all systems, software must have automatic updates enabled for system patches released from their respective vendors. Security patches have to be installed within one month of release from the respective vendor and have to follow the process in accordance with change control process. 
  - Any exceptions to this process have to be documented. 

## 14. Remote Access policy 

  - It is the responsibility of {{CompanyName}} employees, contractors, vendors and agents with remote access privileges to company network to ensure that their remote access connection is given the same consideration as the user's on-site connection to {{CompanyName}}. 
  - Secure remote access must be strictly controlled. Control will be enforced by two factor authentication via one-time password authentication or public/private keys with strong pass- phrases. 
  - Vendor accounts with access to {{CompanyName}} network will only be enabled during the time period the access is required and will be disabled or removed once access is no longer required. 
  - Remote access connection will be setup to be disconnected automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity

## 15. Change control Process 

  - Changes to information resources shall be managed and executed according to a formal change control process. The control process will ensure that changes proposed are reviewed, authorised, tested, implemented, and released in a controlled manner; and that the status of each proposed change is monitored. 
  - All change requests shall be logged whether approved or rejected on a standardised and central system. The approval of all change requests and the results thereof shall be logged.. A log audit trail, maintained at a Business Unit Level, containing relevant information shall be maintained at all times. This should include change request logs, change authorisation and the outcome of the change. No single person should be able to effect changes to production information systems without the approval of other authorised personnel. 
  - A risk assessment shall be performed for all changes and dependant on the outcome, an impact assessment should be performed. 
  - The impact assessment shall include the potential effect on other information resources and potential cost implications. The impact assessment should, where applicable consider compliance with legislative requirements and standards. 
  - All change requests shall be prioritised in terms of benefits, urgency, effort required and potential impact on operations. 
  - Changes shall be tested in an isolated, controlled, and representative environment (where such an environment is feasible) prior to implementation to minimise the effect on the relevant business process, to assess its impact on operations and security and to verify that only intended and approved changes were made. 
  - Any software change and/or update shall be controlled with version control. Older versions shall be retained in accordance with corporate retention and storage management policies. 
  - All changes shall be approved prior to implementation. Approval of changes shall be based on formal acceptance criteria i.e. the change request was done by an authorised user, the impact assessment was performed and proposed changes were tested. 
  - All users, significantly affected by a change, shall be notified of the change. The user representative shall sign-off on the change. Users shall be required to make submissions and comment prior to the acceptance of the change. 
  - Implementation will only be undertaken after appropriate testing and approval by stakeholders. All major changes shall be treated as new system implementation and shall be established as a project. Major changes will be classified according to effort required to develop and implement said changes. 
  - Procedures for aborting and recovering from unsuccessful changes shall be implemented. Should the outcome of a change be different to the expected result (as identified in the testing of the change), procedures and responsibilities shall be noted for the recovery and continuity of the affected areas. Fall back procedures will be in place to ensure systems can revert back to what they were prior to implementation of changes. 
  - Information resources documentation shall be updated on the completion of each change and old documentation shall be archived or disposed of as per the documentation and data retention policies. 
  - All changes will be monitored once they have been rolled-out to the production environment. Deviations from design specifications and test results will be documented and escalated to the solution owner for ratification.

    - Never rely on the client to store sensitive data no matter how trivial. 
    - Disable Error messages that return any information to the user. 
    - Use object inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism wherever possible. 
    - Use environment variables prudently and always check boundaries and buffers. 
    - Applications must validate input to ensure it is well-formed and meaningful. 

## 18. Penetration testing methodology 
  - In this section should be listed the risks inherent in conducting penetration testing over the information systems of the company. Additionally, it should be noted for each mitigation measures that will be taken. 
  - Technical tests must follow the OSSTMM methodology. Tests must be conducted at network, system and application level and must ensure that at least identifies any vulnerabilities documented by OWASP and SANS

The format of the evidence can be variable in each case, screen capture, raw output of security tools, photographs, paper documents, etc. 

## 19. Incident Response Plan 
'Security incident' means any incident (accidental, intentional or deliberate) relating to your communications or information processing systems. The attacker could be a malicious stranger, a competitor, or a disgruntled employee, and their intention might be to steal information or money, or just to damage your company. 
The Incident response plan has to be tested once annually. Copies of this incident response plan is to be made available to all relevant staff members, and take steps to ensure that they understand it and what is expected of them. 
Employees of the company will be expected to report to the security officer for any security related issues. 
The {{CompanyName}} security incident response plan is as follows: 
  1. Each department must report an incident to an member of Incident Response Team. 
  2. That member of the team receiving the report will advise the Incident Response Team of the incident.
  3. The Incident Response Team will investigate the incident and assist the potentially compromised department in limiting the exposure of data and in mitigating the risks associated with the incident. 
  4. The Incident Response Team will resolve the problem to the satisfaction of all parties involved, including reporting the incident and findings to the appropriate parties as necessary. 
  5. The Incident Response Team will determine if policies and processes need to be updated to avoid a similar incident in the future, and whether additional safeguards are required in the environment where the incident occurred, or for the institution. 

The Incident Response Team: 
  - CTO/CEO 
  - Lead DevOps 
  - Lead Development 

In response to a systems compromise, the Response Team and designees will: 

  - Ensure compromised system/s is isolated on/from the network. 
  - Gather, review and analyze the logs and related information from various central and  local safeguards and security controls 
  - Conduct appropriate forensic analysis of compromised system. 
  - Contact internal and external departments and entities as appropriate.
